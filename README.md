# Health-Data-Science---PASSI
As part of the Health Data Science course in the MSc program Data Analytics for Business and Society at Ca' Foscari of Venezia, we worked on an exciting project: HDS Step-by-Passi.🧠📊

🔍 The goal? To analyze and visualize data from the “PASSI” survey (Progress by Local Health Units Toward a Healthier Italy), supporting the interpretation and communication of results in the public health domain.

💡 This project was developed using R and R Markdown, allowing us to perform data wrangling, statistical analysis, and create dynamic reports. It was a great opportunity to apply our skills in a real-world context, collaborating in multidisciplinary teams.

*What is PASSI?*\\
PASSI (Progress by Local Health Units Toward a Healthier Italy) is a national public health surveillance system managed by the Italian National Institute of Health (Istituto Superiore di Sanità). It collects continuous survey data on lifestyle behaviors, health conditions, and preventive practices of the adult population in Italy.
Due to privacy and data protection regulations, the dataset is not publicly available and therefore cannot be shared in this repository.
